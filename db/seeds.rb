The ambiance is this park is tops and it's a great place to spend the day. For those who want to take it all in, but not ride anything... it's a freebie! One improvements suggestion and word of caution: The 'all-day-wristband' for unlimited riding includes about 80% of the rides.

Post.create({title:"Some Words of Caution", image:"http://www.galdimechanicalscorp.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/History-of-statue-of-liberty-1.jpg", content:"Our National Parks Service always does a good job keeping grounds clean and monuments open as often as possible, and Lady Liberty is no different. I am disappointed in the process necessary to register for the walk up to the crown (almost six months in advance or more), but our Lady Liberty is aging and I understand the precautions and limitations necessary to preserve her. She's as grand as ever after her recent cleaning and restoration. I got to see her with a real flame when I was a kid, but now the torch is lit with a gold flame sculpture that reflects sunlight during the day and is lit artificially at night with lights.Some hints for families. If you're going to get inside Lady Liberty, and especially the crown, you need to reserve the tickets online well in advance. On your date of visit, arrive at Battery Park EARLY, like 8am. Ignore all the ticket hawkers and go directly to the round Castle Clinton to buy or pick up your tickets. If you arrive even as late as 10am, you will end up with a 3 hour wait time between the ticket lines and the security checkpoint lines.Food and water. Bring it with you in a backpack. Carry two waters for each person in your group, and pack food that does not require refrigeration and has protein to carry you through the day, like PBJ sandwiches. The only place to eat on Liberty Island is the Liberty Cafe, and it is an absolute tourist trap in every way (expensive, unorganized, and bad food). Trust me, if you eat at the Cafe, you'll wish you'd brought the sandwiches!Lastly, if you are a police officer in NY or NJ, bring your sidearm, just like you would if you were off duty in your own area. After you get your tickets, respectfully approach the first security person you see and identify yourself and let them know you are armed. They will whisk you and your family through the security line and save you the long wait. If you are going into the Statue of Liberty, you will have to lock up your sidearm along with your backpack on Liberty Island, but no big deal. Unfortunately, police officers from other outside states are not given this courtesy, so leave your sidearm at home, or locked in the hotel safe for this particular day; they will not even let you board the boat from Battery Park.Enjoy your day!", vote_up: 0, vote_down: 0, user_id: 1 , location_id: 26, category_id: 2 })

Post.create({title:"Made My 3 Year Old SO Happy", image:"http://blog.roblox.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Intrepid-Museum-Vertical-Logo.jpg", content:" My son is going to turn 3 in a month. He loves planes, helicopters, boats and space ships so I thought that a father son day at the Intrepid would be a good idea. I was a little worried after reading some reviews that we would be stuck in long lines and he would get antsy and bored before we even got in so I researched the heck out of it. I opted to purchase tickets online Friday night and pick them up at will call the next day. It turns out, kids under 3 are free. I knew that I only had so much time with a kid his age, so I got a 'GA - General Admission including Space Shuttle Pavilion' ticket for myself, no ticket for him. So yesterday, a sunny somewhat warm spring Saturday, we made our way to the west side. The Hudson River can be cold and windy, so sunny and warm is important. We arrived at 9:45, the museum opens at 10:00 to the public. There was a line with about 40 people in it but they were all in the ticket line. The will call line was empty! At 10:00 on the dot, they let us in. Will call went without a hitch and by 10:05 we were the first people to walk in the gates. I wondered if I would need some proof of age for my son since he was free, but nobody asked. I just stated that he was under 3. I could not have been happier! My thoughts were, lets get up to the bridge (the tallest point on the ship) before the crowds get in there. It was a good plan. My son absolutely loved going in the ship. Lots of those oval ship doorways, hallways and stairs. Steep, narrow stairways. Very hazardous to children, elderly, overweight and out-of-shape people. I asked the first employee I saw how many people get tripped up in here and he chuckled and said 'too many to count'. I did question my decision to bring my under 3 year old up there but since there was absolutely nobody there other than us, we were able to take our time and not feel rushed or like we were in the way. We did well, but it was not without risk. Going down is even more perilous than going up. The stairs are almost ladders. We made it all the way to the bridge and back down without seeing another tourist. A nice older gentlemen named 'Buddy', who I suspect was a veteran, gave my son a collectible Intrepid card. Very nice. After exiting onto the deck I thought, lets go see the space shuttle before it gets crowded. So we made our way to the Shuttle pavilion. The door was closed and it looked dark but when we entered. Again, we were the first ones to enter! Success! You need to present your separate Shuttle ticket on entry. They then take your photo against a blue wall with the hopes of luring you into purchasing a photo package when you exit. For the record, the space shuttle Enterprise never actually flew into space. It was used for training. It was a nice experience and my sons eyes lit up when he saw the 'spaceship', or 'rocket ship' but if time or money is limited, not sure it is worth the extra money. You cannot enter the shuttle. There are stairs that go up and wrap around the front end of the shuttle and there are some exhibits, but I have been to Cape Canaveral in Florida and this was nothing compared to that. On exit, we were presented with the photo package. I actually bought just the large photo because it was a nice photo of my son and I and I thought it would be a nice keepsake for my sons wall, but it was a complete rip-off at $22.25. It is insulting how much they charge. We were getting hungry so we headed to the onboard Au Bon Pain chain. We had a nice mozzarella sandwich and of course, an ice cream! The ice cream is just a good humor fridge, no cones, but 3 year olds are not that discerning when it comes to ice cream, so Spiderman ice cream on a stick it was. I wanted to watch the good looking documentary with smoke machines but this was 'scary' to my son. We then saw some anti-aircraft guns and toured the deck full of planes and helicopters. We skipped the sub and Concord that required extra tickets. I HIGHLY recommend eating at the nearby Gotham Market afterwards, a wonderful food market. My son and I had a blast!

The mineral/gem collection was really cool, but I didn't have the energy to spend as much time as I would have liked to really get the full experience. I also wished I had been able to spend more time in the earth/space part of the museum. I do wish that the pieces in the museum had more historical information. Most of the pieces lack dates and many are noted as reproductions, so it is often unclear if the piece is real or not, and how old it is. I would definitely visit again, but only after going to The Met and spending at least another full day there.", vote_up: 0, vote_down: 0, user_id: 1, location_id: 35, category_id: 4 })

The food is decent and what you'd expect, but the ale is what makes it worth going every time. There's something about drinking and imported beer at an antique oak bench from a wooden keg that keeps me coming back.", vote_up:0 , vote_down:0 , user_id:1 , location_id:14 , category_id:1 })
